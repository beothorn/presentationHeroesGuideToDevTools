## How do we today

When you follow the common practice of our industry, most of the time things are fine.
We have unit tests to protect us, we have functional tests, we do QA, smoke tests and all of those let us sleep at night.
Even when we deploy, we can do it in a way that if we realize something went wrong we can go back.
When everything is fine, everything is fine.

## The villain

But sometimes everything looks fine, until it isn't.

## Super-speed

You need to be able to just start calling endpoints.

Learn the fetch api.

Make yourself able to do this without burocracy.

## Wait, but this is what rest clients do

Yes, but chrome a lot more flexible than regular rest clients.

## Share your power

Extensions are code. Use version control, make them available in your internal repo.
